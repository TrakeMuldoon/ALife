I need to design an architecture for this, and I’m having some trouble. I will attempt to lay out  the parameters as best I can.

In my artificial life program, I need to define the brains for each of the creatures. I had originally considered neural nets, and in the future that is one of the brains I will use, however, it is not the one I’m working on right now.

The brain I am working on right now is called the “BehaviourBrain” and it is quite simple.

Sample 
If EyeballCluster1.SeesSomething EQUALS False 							Then	MoveForward(0.88)	//If there’s nothing in front, go forward
If EarCluster2.Volume GreaterThan 0.5 								Then	Rotate(0.55)		//If you hear something on the right, turn to it
If EarCluster1.Volume LessThan EarCluster2.Volume						Then	Rotate(-0.55) 		//If it’s louder on the left, turn left
If EyeballCluster1.SeesSomething equals True and EyeballCluster1.Red GreaterThan 0.5		Then 	Bite(0.5)		// If you see something, and that thing is red, omnomnom

The spec is like this

“If [A](someVariable) [B](someOperator) [C](someVariable||someConstant) [D](AND [A][B][C]) then [E](SomeAction) with Intensity [F]”

Where 
[A] represents some dynamic value associated with the agent who owns the brain
	[A] Could be a Double, Int, String, or Bool
[B] is some Operation (GreaterThan, LessThan, Contains, Equals, etc.) that applies to the Type of [A]
[C] is either some Constant of the same type as [A] or another variable on the Agent which is the same type as [A]

[D] simply means that you can optionally chain many of these “Conditionals”

[E] refers to one of the actions that can be taken by the agent
[F] is either a constant, or a variable on the agent, but it MUST be a double.

The theory is that having a set of these behaviours will create an agent who can make meaningful decisions and have interesting emergent behavior
Another large advantages is that it will be very easy to manually create agents that behave a certain way, as opposed to Neural Nets, which are very difficult to custom define.
The next large advantage over neural networks is that the three reproduction options (Clone, Asexual, and Sexual) would be very easy, as each Behaviour is self contained, as opposed to a neural net, which is by nature bound up with itself.

Now… 
The problem.
The variables which are key here: [A], the value that are on the agents, are much more complicated than I implied earlier.

There are (currently) three types that could feed that [A]
1.	A “SenseCluster” has a set of Inputs.
a.	EyeCluster has the following Inputs
i.	SeesSomething [Bool]
ii.	HowRed [Double] (represents 0-255)
iii.	HowGreen [Double]
iv.	HowBlue [Double]
v.	HowManyThings [Int]
vi.	IsClose [Bool]
vii.	IsFar [Bool]
But each of those Inputs has three subvalues
1.	Value [T]
2.	Delta [T] (since last change, not last turn)
3.	ModifiedThisTurn [Bool]
2.	Properties
a.	Properties like “Strenght” or Energy
i.	These are represented as Inputs as well so they have
1.	Value [T]
2.	Delta [T]
3.	ModifiedThisTurn [Bool]
3.	Actions can also be represented as Inputs, and they have two subvalues
a.	ValueLastTurn [Double]
b.	ActivatedLastTurn [Bool]

So, the issue here is that an [A] could be 
SenseCluster.Input.Delta if it is a “sensory based input”
Or
Strength.Delta if it is a “property based input”
Or
MoveForward.ValueLastTurn if it is an “Action based Input”

And they don’t all share a consistent type.

The second problem is the creation of these behaviours.
There are three main creation methods

1.	Randomly generated. This will be used when randomly generating agents (which is 90% of the time), or when a reproduced agent needs a new behavior.
a.	Seems to me this requires all the Inputs available in a list somewhere, but they don’t share a type, so it’s tough to have them all share a List, 
b.	Unless their type is “Action<T>()” which would store lambdas. And make the “Conditional” part of the behavior just a big lambda. This is cool, but it doesn’t work for the other two methods.
2.	From a string.
a.	This will be done when the agents are defined in configuration, or a new rule is added from the UI.
b.	This requires that all the available inputs be stored in such a way that they can be looked up in a hashtable format, or found somehow. (assume for now that the input is valid. If it is invalid, we’ll just throw it away)
3.	Modified from an earlier Behavior
a.	This is the main reason why the first option from Randomly generated, doesn’t work. If the inputs are stored in the Behaviour as a lambda, then you can’t extract the lambda and change the values, (i.e. change the [A], change the [B] or Change the value of [C])
b.	So the Behaviours must be stored in some kind of composite fashion.
