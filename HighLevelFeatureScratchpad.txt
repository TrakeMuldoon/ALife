Brain Behaviours
	Represent Rules as an Array, to assist with repdouctution
Brain Neural Network

Load many vluaes and features from a Config (See Config Spec)

Actions as Inputs (Input<bool> of "Have I just completed this action")
ActionEngagemnt as Inputs (i.e. "collided")
Inputs as Actions (i.e. if Inputs take resources to use, then it may be a decision to use them)

DistanceToGoal Input
OrientationToGoal Input
ProximityDetector Input
CollisionInput

Fitness Function Concepts
1. Reproduction based on triggers happening during run
	Reaching certain areas, 
	Achieving certain age
	Maximimzing/hitting certain property thresholds (energy > 100)
	Reproducing voluntarily as an Action
2. Run envrionment until all creatures are dead, then evaluate fitness of all agents, and reproduce only the top X percent

Reproduction
Need a way to have a certain amount of mutability
	Repro for Behaviour Brains
		Reproduce X percent of rules intact
		Add/Remove 1/2 rules
		Modify 1/2 rules
	Repro for NN Brains
		Change 1-2 weights in each layer
	Modify certain properties as well
		MovementEnergyCost
	Modify Physical pieces
		Hearing Distance
		Sight
		Number of eyes

Naming/Ancestry
Each artificially created agent is given a three letter code, starting with AAA, and incrementing by 1 each time 
AAA,AAB... AAZ, AAa, AAb ...etc. This is 140000 possible agents.
Each child of that agent will append a new character onto this root which will be [A-Za-z0-9], so each agent can only have 62 children.
Ancestry detection is easy just saying
if(my.Name.startswith(target.name)) then they are an ancestor
if(target.Name.StartsWith(my.name)) then they are a descendant of mine
