Need to add collision level
 - Needs to be added to the constructor/scenario somehow
 - something generic

Need Ears


Need a custom "SoundObject"
 - Simply inherits from WorldObject.
 - Helps itself with distance calculations
 - Does it contain an orientation implicitly? (Perhaps cardinal rather than specific)
	-Perhaps it has four "directional" inputs. "Front", "Back", "Left", "Right". allowing (with some reasonableness) all 8 cardinal directions
 -It adds itself to its collision grid on entry, and removes itself entirely on its next turn.
 - This means that they need to add themselves in a specific position in the allactiveobjects grid.

__ BUG! Children are being added to the end of the agent list. Is this the desired behaviour? 
  - I think it is actually.

- Need capability for an agent or world object to generate a sound. 
  - Should be as simple as creating a sound object at the appropriate time and adding it to the relevant collision grid.
  - I don't think the agents need to be aware of the sounds they've created. 

- Need a Scenario that supports this
 - 1. No directionality, just two ears, each with a volume. tracker. Collide with target (Sound Emitter), and regen.
 - 2. Directionality. One ear. Collide with target, (sound emitter), and regen.1
