Inputs as Actions (i.e. if Inputs take resources to use, then it may be a decision to use them)

Brain Behaviours
Brain Neural Network

Fitness Function Concepts
1. Reproduction based on triggers happening during run
	Reaching certain areas, 
	Achieving certain age
	Maximimzing/hitting certain property thresholds (energy > 100)
	Reproducing voluntarily as an Action
2. Run envrionment until all creatures are dead, then evaluate fitness of all agents, and reproduce only the top X percent

Reproduction
Need a way to have a certain amount of mutability
	Repro for Behaviour Brains
		Reproduce X percent of rules intact
		Add/Remove 1/2 rules
		Modify 1/2 rules
	Repro for NN Brains
		Change 1-2 weights in each layer
	Modify certain properties as well
		MovementEnergyCost
	Modify Physical pieces
		Hearing Distance
		Sight
		Number of eyes
